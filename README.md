The Convex Hull problem is a fundamental problem in computational geometry. It involves finding the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in a two-dimensional plane. The resulting polygon is called the convex hull.

I will use Recursion to solve the Problem

run main.py to see the result

you can change the range and number of points in CONSTANT.py
